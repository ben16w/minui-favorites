# MinUI Favorites

Tools to manage a Favorites collection in [MinUI](https://github.com/shauninman/MinUI).

## Description

This project provides a set of tools to manage a MinUI collection named "Favorites". The tools are packaged in .pak directories and includes the ability to add and remove games from the Favorites collection, as well as clear the Recently Played list. The Favorites collection can be accessed from the MinUI main menu, under Collections, and is sorted alphabetically.
