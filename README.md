# MinUI Favorites

Apps to manage a Favorites collection in [MinUI](https://github.com/shauninman/MinUI).

## Description

This project provides a set of MinUI apps to manage a collection named "Favorites". The apps are packaged in .pak directories to be used as tools within MinUI. The current features include the ability to add and remove games from the Favorites collection, as well as clear the Recently Played list. The Favorites collection can be accessed from MinUI, under Collections, and is sorted alphabetically.

## Installation

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/ben16w/minui-favorites/releases) from GitHub and extract the zip.
2. Mount your MinUI SD card to your computer.
3. Copy the .pak directories to the correct device folder in the "/Tools" directory on the SD card.
4. Unmount your SD Card and insert it into your MinUI device.
5. Done!

Note: The device folder is based from the name of your device. For example, if you are using a TrimUI Brick, the folder is "tg3040". Alternatively, if you're not sure which folder to use, you can copy the .pak directories to all device folders.
