# MinUI Favorites

Apps to manage a Favorites collection in [MinUI](https://github.com/shauninman/MinUI).

## Description

This project provides a set of MinUI apps to manage a collection named "Favorites". The apps are packaged in .pak folders to be used as tools within MinUI. The current features include the ability to add and remove the most recently played game from the Favorites collection, as well as clear the Recently Played list. The Favorites collection can be accessed in MinUI, under Collections, and is sorted alphabetically.

## Installation

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/ben16w/minui-favorites/releases) from GitHub and extract the zip.
2. Connect your MinUI SD card to your computer.
3. Copy the .pak folders to the correct device folder in the "/Tools" directory on the SD card.
4. Remove your SD Card and insert it into your MinUI device.
5. Done!

Note: The device folder name is based on the name of your device. For example, if you are using a TrimUI Brick, the folder is "tg3040". Alternatively, if you're not sure which folder to use, you can copy the .pak folders to all the device folders.
